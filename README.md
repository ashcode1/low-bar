# Lowbar Part 1

In this sprint, you will re-implement the Underscore library. You will need to setup an NPM project from scratch, create the files and directories you need, and set up your test environment. Make sure you also install the NPM package `husky` and use a `precommit` script in your `package.json` file that lints your code using ESLint. 

## Tasks

The Lowbar Sprint involves reimplementing a JS library as if you were its author. For Part 1 of this sprint (we'll be coming back to this in week 2), you'll need to reimplement the following methods:

## Core

These are the core functions you should aim to get finished;

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains

You should be heavily referencing the APIs of the following;

1. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
2. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
3. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)

## Advanced

These are a little harder but will be very beneficial to try and complete.

1. pluck
2. reduce
3. every
4. some
5. extends
6. defaults


# Lowbar Part 2 (advanced)

This time, the methods you need to implement are a little trickier. Many of them are utility methods for functions, such as `throttle` which stops a function being called more often than requested. Your experience with higher order functions, recursion and searching and sorting algorithms this week may come in useful!
 

## Tasks

1. once
2. memoize
3. shuffle
4. invoke
5. sortBy (NB the Underscore library uses the native JavaScript sort but feel free to use your sort algorithm!)
6. zip
7. sortedIndex
8. flatten
9. intersection
10. difference


# Advanced

11. indexOf (again, this time with a binary search)
12. throttle
13. delay

## Resources

You should be heavily referencing the APIs of the following:

1. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
2. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)
3. [Sinon - spies, stubs & mocks](http://sinonjs.org/)
4. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
